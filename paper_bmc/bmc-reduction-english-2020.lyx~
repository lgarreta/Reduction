 The simulations are one of the most important tools for studying and understand
ing the underlying mechanisms of the protein folding process.
 Protein folding simulations have experienced substantial progress in the
 last years, they are performed using diverse technologies and they are
 reaching the microseconds and greater timescales, which generates very
 long trajectories.
 As a result, the analysis of these trajectories entails to complications
 and is necessary to create tools to simplify them, so that both the main
 events and the temporal order in which they occur are preserved.

\end_inset

 We present an algorithm to reduce long protein folding trajectories in
 a fast and parallel way.
 The algorithm divides a trajectory into segments to be processed in parallel,
 and from each segment selects the most representative conformations using
 a rapid clustering strategy, which takes advantage of the temporal order
 of the conformations to compare them locally, avoiding an all-versus-all
 comparison.
 The algorithm reduces a trajectory in a high percentage, preserving both
 the patterns and the structure obtained by other more complex reduction
 techniques.
 In addition, its performance is close to that shown by other efficient
 reduction techniques, and this performance is improved when executed in
 parallel using more than one core.

\end_inset

 The developed algorithm quickly reduces a protein folding trajectory by
 selecting its most representative conformations and thus preserving both
 its structure and its temporal order.
 The reduced trajectories can be used as input for more complex analysis
 techniques and even for other reduction techniques that become impractical
 when faced with long folding trajectories.
 The algorithm is fast and is designed to run in parallel on conventional
 PCs with multi-core technology, which are present in most typical research
 laboratories.

\begin_layout Section*
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We present a parallel algorithm to reduce protein folding trajectories which
 quickly obtains representative conformations, conserving both their three-dimen
sional structure (3D) and their temporal order.
 Proteins play a fundamental role in all living beings, but to be functional,
 they must fold from their linear amino acid (AA) sequence to a unique 3D
 or native state, which is known as the protein folding process.
 Understanding the mechanisms and rules of this process has been one of
 the most pursued objectives of computational biology, and an important
 theoretical tool to study it has been the simulations of protein folding.
 These simulations generate folding trajectories (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Folding-Trajectory"

\end_inset

), which describe the sequence of states that proteins follow as a function
 of time during their folding process.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Understanding the protein folding mechanism remains a grand challenge in
 structural biology.
 In the past several years, computational theories in molecular dynamics
 have been employed to shed light on the folding process.
 Coupled with high computing power and large scale storage, researchers
 now can computationally simulate the protein folding process in atomistic
 details at femtosecond temporal resolution.
 Such simulation often produces a large number of folding trajectories,
 each consisting of a series of 3D conformations of the protein under study.
 As a result, effectively managing and analyzing such trajectories is becoming
 increasingly important.

\begin_layout Standard
Folding simulations mainly use the molecular dynamics (DM) method, which
 due to its computational cost is limited to small proteins (<100 AA) and
 very short times (picoseconds or microseconds).
 However, technological innovations have allowed significant advances in
 these simulations, both on time scales and technology to execute them.
 In 2011, using the Anton supercomputer, specially designed for protein
 folding 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Shaw2008"

\end_inset

, full simulations of 12 proteins were published, several on the order of
 milliseconds 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Shaw2011"

\end_inset

.
 And more recently, in 2016, the Anton 2 supercomputer became operational
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Shaw2014"

\end_inset

, being up to ten times faster than its predecessor Anton.
 As an economic alternative, in 2014 graphic processing units (GPU) were
 used to simulate, on the order of microseconds, the folding of 17 proteins
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nguyen2014"

\end_inset

.
 And years earlier, in 2007, the "folding@home" distributed computing platform
 utilized as many as 250,000 PCs, voluntarily available around the world,
 to simulate on the order of microseconds the folding of the villin-headpiece
 protein

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These innovations show significant progress in protein folding simulations,
 both on time scales and technology to execute them, and as a result the
 generation of trajectories with millions of conformations.
 But due to their large number of conformations, their processing and analysis
 in conventional PCs is computationally expensive, and new algorithms are
 needed to efficiently simplify them, seeking to preserve as much information
 as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two approaches used to reduce these simulations have been the dimensionality
 reduction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Duan2013"

\end_inset

 and clustering 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Peng2018"

\end_inset

.
 In the dimensionality reduction approach, conformations are transformed
 into reduced sets of variables that represent them as well as possible.
 Here, both linear and non-linear techniques have been used (e.g.
 principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Das2006"

\end_inset

, diffusion maps 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kim2015"

\end_inset

).
 However, many of these techniques, instead of reducing a trajectory, analyze
 it, losing the structural information of the conformations (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:lost-info-dimensionality"

\end_inset

, top) and making the results explainable only when observed together.
 In addition, many of these techniques require pairwise comparisons, which
 are computationally expensive when trajectories are very large.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the clustering approach, the conformations are assigned to groups that
 share similar characteristics (e.g., similarity with the native structure),
 and from each group an average representative or its general characteristics
 can be taken.
 Here, hierarchical and partitioned groupings have been used (e.g., k-means

key "Doerr2017"

, link 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 However, the groups lose their temporal order since they can include conformati
ons that occur in very distant times (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:lost-info-dimensionality"

\end_inset

, bottom).
 And also they require pairwise comparisons, which are computationally expensive
 when trajectories are very large.

To reduce a folding trajectory, the proposed algorithm divides the path
 into segments that are processed in parallel.
 For each segment, characteristic events are quickly extracted using the
 rapid clustering strategy of Hobohm and Sander (1992) adapted for protein
 folding trajectories; and from these results, the most representative events
 are selected by a strategy of k-medoids

\begin_layout Standard
In this work, we used the TM-score metric for pairwise comparison of protein
 structures 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zhang2004"

\end_inset

.
 This metric is used in both the proposed algorithm and in the techniques
 for reduction of protein folding used to compare its results.
 The TM-score is more sensitive to the global topology than local variations,
 and so it estimates the pairwise similarity of protein structures much
 more accurately than the Root Mean Square-Deviation (RMSD), a common metric
 used for the same purpose.
 The TM-score ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is a perfect match.
 Based on statistics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "zhang2010"

\end_inset

, a TM-Score lower than 0.17 indicates two random structures with no relation
 of similarity, and a TM-Score higher than 0.5 indicates that the structures
 have a degree of similarity that is not given by chance.

The proposed algorithm reduces a trajectory of protein folding in three

 Each step involves a strategy to improve the efficiency of the algorithm
 when working with large protein folding trajectories.

Here, we improved the fast clustering algorithm of Hobohm and Sander (1992)
 to work with a trajectory segment and exploit the implicit order of its
 conformations given by its simulation time (black horizontal line, Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 The algorithm selects the initial conformation at time

\end_inset

 as the first characteristic.
 Then, the algorithm compares the previous characteristic with the following
 conformation.
 If dissimilar, then the conformation becomes a new characteristic, otherwise,
 the conformation is redundant and is removed (red dots, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 The process continues with the rest of conformations until finishing in
 the final one at time

, thus producing the set of representative characteristics of the segment

) that calculates the k conformations (medoids) whose average difference
 between all the other members of the group is minimal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the PAM algorithm needs as input the dissimilarity matrix with
 the pairwise comparison of all-versus-all conformations of the trajectory
 segment, which is an intensive computational task when the number of conformati
ons is very large.
 But, this task is feasible to perform since the algorithm is working here
 with a reduced set of characteristic conformations (previous step) of a
 trajectory segment and not of the complete trajectory.

Three tests were carried out to evaluate the capacity and performance of
 the proposed algorithm: first, reduction of three trajectories using the
 proposed algorithm; second, comparison of the intrinsic information preserved
 by the reductions from both the proposed algorithm and two other folding
 reduction techniques; and third a performance comparison.

\end_inset

 It can be seen from the plots that the algorithm try to find the most represent
ative conformations from their original trajectories, conserving two fundamental
 properties: the structure and the temporal ordering of the original conformatio
ns.
 Other folding reduction methods lose these properties in their reductions,
 as we will see in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result, these reduced trajectories become a summary of the original
 ones and can be used as inputs for more complex analyzes, or even for other
 reduction methods that require pairwise comparisons and become impractical
 for large trajectories.

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we compared how the intrinsic information captured by other folding
 reductions techniques from a folding trajectory is also preserved in the
 reductions produced by the proposed algorithm.
 First, two reduced trajectories were computed from the original trajectory
 of the villin-headpiece protein using the proposed algorithm (Figure 6),
 and then the intrinsic information was computed on these trajectories using
 nMDS and clustering reductions (Figure 7) (see Methods for the details
 of the trajectory and techniques).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it can be seen from the Figure 7, the pattern of circles of points from
 nMDS, and the structure of three groups from clustering, repeat in both
 the original and the reduced trajectories.
 This shows that the reductions produced by the proposed algorithm largely
 preserve the intrinsic information observed in the original trajectory.
 Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has several advantages.
 First, it avoids the calculation of the dissimilarity matrix as it is done
 by nMDS and clustering, that is a computationally expensive task for medium
 to large trajectories.
 Second, its reductions are a set of protein conformations, contrary to
 reduced transformations as the produced with other techniques as nMDS,
 PCA, Isomap or diffusion maps

 viewed together.

Algorithm performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested in two cases: first,
 a runtime comparison with other three typical techniques for folding reduction:
 nMDS, clustering, and PCA; and second, a parallel comparison, running the
 algorithm with several cores (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 For both tests, the trajectory corresponds to the first 100k conformations
 from the full trajectory of the trp-cage protein, described above in datasets
 section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the comparison between techniques (Figure

.A), several subtrajectories of different lengths were reduced by all the
 techniques.
 PCA showed the most efficient runtimes followed by our proposed algorithm
 FR, contrary to nMDS and clustering that becomes impractical when faced
 with short to medium trajectories.
 However, the proposed algorithm has the advantage to easily run in parallel,
 contrary to the other techniques, and when it runs using two cores, its
 runtime is reduced by half and becomes faster than PCA.

 time the number of cores is duplicated.
 This speedup maintains for up to ~8 cores, and then it reduces to the minimum
 after ~30 cores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results show that the algorithm has a good performance when compared
 with the other techniques, and this performance improves more when it is
 run in parallel using more than one core.
 As a consequence, the speedup of the algorithm scale quasi-linearly with
 the number of processing cores, almost until 8x, and with 32 cores the
 algorithm still achieves a speedup of 16x

 Now, considering that multi-core technology is quite commonplace for even
 desktop computers, the proposed algorithm has the capacity to take advantage
 of this technology to reduce large protein folding trajectories in a fast
 parallel manner, with runtimes closer or better than other techniques commonly
 used for this task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the progress in long timescale simulations of protein folding has
 enabled the generation of large folding trajectories, the new challenge
 is in their analysis, but due to the millions of conformations they can
 contain, their processing and analysis becomes difficult or impractical.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we have proposed a fast and parallel algorithm to simplify large protein
 folding trajectories.
 The algorithm reduces a trajectory by splitting it into segments and then
 reducing each in parallel using a fast clustering strategy which avoids
 the pairwise comparison of all structures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the results, the algorithm can achieve resumed trajectories
 with high compression of data and preserving their main conformations,
 what was confirmed when patterns and clusters produced by other folding
 reduction techniques were also observed in the algorithm reductions.
 Furthermore, the algorithm outperformed the performance of the other techniques
, apart from the PCA technique.
 However if the algorithm uses additional processing cores, it outperforms
 all the other techniques at larger values.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, the reductions produced by the proposed algorithm are limited
 to create a summary of the main events of a protein folding trajectory
 without performing any kind of analysis, as other techniques do.
 But, these summarized trajectories can be used as input to these and other
 techniques that serve the same purpose and which were not designed to handle
 large protein folding trajectories.
